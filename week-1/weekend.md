## Weekend

### Core

**Challenges**

Either with a pair or on your own, complete the following challenges.
- [Review: Abstract Data Structures](../../../../review-abstract-data-structures-challenge)
- [Review: Calculating Subsets with Recursion](../../../../review-calculating-subsets-with-recursion-challenge)
- [Review: Reflect and Iterate](../../../../review-reflect-and-iterate-challenge)
- [Review: Reflect on Learning](../../../../review-reflect-on-learning-challenge)
- [Review: Revisit Roman Numerals](../../../../review-revisit-roman-numeral-challenge)

**Review**

- [Top Challenges](../resources/key-challenges-p1w1.md) - This is list of the key challenges from week 1. We strongly suggest that you solo on any of these challenges on which you struggled.
- The [Sudoku Challenge](../../../../sudoku-challenge) is **extremely representative** of the type of work you will be asked to do in interviews during "whiteboarding challenges." Sudoku has some of the great hallmarks that stimulate great conversations between applicants and employers: recursion versus iteration, complexity of algorithm, sophistication of algorithm, time to produce a working bit of code, etc. Therefore we recommend that you take Sudoku as far as you can! Complete the other prep work and give continued progress on this challenge the remainder of time available.


**Prep for Monday**

- Watch [Inheritance & Mixins](https://talks.devbootcamp.com/inheritance-and-mixins) (closed captioning available) to learn how inheritance and modules work in Ruby.
- Read Chapters 2 and 3 of [Practical Object Oriented Programming in Ruby](http://amazon.com/Practical-Object-Oriented-Design-Ruby-Addison-Wesley-ebook/dp/B0096BYG7C/).  There are hardcopies available on the DBC bookshelf.  As you read, come up with your own real-world object--like the author's bicycle--and try to apply each concept to your object.  You should finish reading the book throughout Week 2.
- Read the Apprenticeship Pattern on [exposing your ignorance](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813/ch02.html#expose_your_ignorance).  It's really hard for smart, hard-working, passionate people to admit when they don't get something. Our natural tendency is to guard our ignorance so that everyone thinks we're competent.  Effective developers expose their ignorance. Period.
- [Ruby Scope](../readings/ruby-scope/README.md)

### Inspiration

- The challenges provided during the week are a guide to start you on a learning path. They should serve as a minimum goal for your learning.  For the high bar, consider that some of our students [wrote and published their own gem](https://github.com/sandbochs/local_message) while still in Phase 1, [wrote useful applications](http://www.codequizzes.com/) over the weekend between phase 1 and 2, and went on to [generally change the world shortly thereafter](https://devbootcamp.com/blog/2013-08-19-how-dbcers-are-turning-your-browser-into-a-snake-playing-gosling-loving-wonderwolrd).
